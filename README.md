just plugin i have made so far. self explanatory plugin.

i dont think the loop taunt and ultra daily are still working fine.

note for dungeon: It will cause your grim to not responding after running it for about 3-4 hours (though Iâ€™m not exactly sure).

auto aggro: it will aggro any monsters if there are any player in the monster's cell
          
  example: acc1 in r1, acc2 in r2, acc3 in r3. turning on the auto aggro will aggroing monsters in r1, r2, r3. if acc3 moves to r4, it will start aggroing r1,r2,r4  (as long as the plugin is still on).

So, there's no need to manually find the monster ID.
