just plugin i have made so far. self explanatory plugin.

i dont think the loop taunt and ultra daily are still working fine.

ultra speaker: place all accs in speaker'cell, equip gear and enrage, turn on the infinite range, enable plugin. The enhancements in the plugin are just recommendations.

auto aggro: it will aggro any monsters if there are any player in the monster's cell
          
  example: acc1 in r1, acc2 in r2, acc3 in r3. turning on the auto aggro will aggroing monsters in r1, r2, r3. if acc3 moves to r4, it will start aggroing r1,r2,r4  (as long as the plugin is still on).

So, there's no need to manually find the monster ID.
